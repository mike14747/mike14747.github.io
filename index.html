            <p>This page is devoted to my recent trip to Peru... hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu being the
                highlight of the vacation.</p>
            <p>This trip began with 2 days in Lima, where we enjoyed both the local cuisine and toured some of the
                local markets, as well as an art museum specializing in Incan art. Lima has a much warmer and dryer
                climate because of its lower altitude and proximity to the ocean.</p>
            <p>After a flight to Cusco, we spent a couple of days getting acclimated to the higher altitude. We didn't
                miss the chance to have lunch with some of the indigenous peoples in the Sacred Valley.</p>
            <p>Then it was onto the Inca Trail. We hiked up and down the Andes Mountains for 4 days, totaling 33.5
                miles before reaching our destination... Machu Picchu. Typically, the Inca Trail is 26.5 miles, but we
                couldn't help but leave the trail any time we had a chance to visit some 'off the trail' ruins...
                eventually adding 7 miles to our total.</p>
            <p>Some days were harder than others, as day 2 found us climbing the equivalent of 440 flights of stairs
                and back down another 200 before collapsing at our campsite.</p>
            <p>The stone steps and paths are 500+ years old. They're irregular to say the least. Some are narrow, some
                are wide, some are shallow and some are called 'monkey stairs' because they're so steep and tall that
                you need to use your hands and climb them like a monkey would.</p>
            <p>After living on the trail for 4 days, it was a relief to finally arrive at Machu Picchu. We walked the
                ruins before departing to our hotel for a long overdue shower.</p>
            <p>After a nice evening back in civilization, it was time to climb Wayna Picchu mountain... which is the
                mountain behind the classic image of Machu Picchu.</p>
