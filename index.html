            <img id=profile_pic src="images/mike_profile_pic.jpg" alt="My Profile Pic">

            <p>Mike Gullo has worked in the tech field for 30+ years as an electronics technician. His most recent role
                was in designing, building, programming (including writing custom bios modifications for graphics cards
                and configuration files for running them) and maintaining a sizable array of nearly 300 high-end
                computer servers.</p>
            <p>He's currently attending Case Western Reserve University transitioning into his new career as a
                programmer. He already has many years of experience in PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS. This latest schooling (at CWRU)
                will enrich and expand his expertise into the other areas necessary to be a Full-Stack developer.</p>
            <p>Often found in the kitchen making healthy, nutritious and (most importantly) great tasting meals. This
                is more than just a mild hobby.</p>
                <p>He serves on the planning committee and as a volunteer for the National Health Association (a 70+year old organization focused on health and wellness).</p>
            <p>When he isn't at his computer or in the kitchen, he loves cycling, gardening, hiking the national parks,
                attending health/nutrition conferences. His most recent trip to Peru was one of his most memorable.</p>
            <p>Baseball (as a fan and spectator) is another passion. His interest in statistics and data analysis makes
                a perfect match with the game that is so heavily statistic oriented.</p>
