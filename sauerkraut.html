            <p>This is my favorite sauerkraut recipe. It doesn't use any salt and it's just raw, fermented veggies...
                nothing else added.</p>
            <p>Some people think you need to use salt as a brining agent when making sauerkraut. Not true! Cabbage
                naturally contains all the pre/pro biotics neccessary for the process.</p>
            <p>The two key things I do to unleash those key pre/pro biotics are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, blend the cores of the cabbage with enough water to make a slurry in a high-speed blender.
                    Then, mix this slurry with the rest of the ingredients.</li>
                <li>The second thing I do to accelerate the brining process is to thoroughly and vigorously massage the
                    shredded cabbage.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now, onto my <b>raw, no-salt</b> sauerkraut recipe (note: I've included a standard size table spoon in
                many of the pics as a reference in lieu of explicit portion sizes)...</p>

                <p class="brief">Give it a little kick</p>
                <p>Coarsely chop turmeric (upper left), ginger root (lower left), dried chili peppers (lower right),
                    garlic (upper right).</p>
                <p>You can use any or all of these items. I prefer all!</p>

                <p class="clear_left">Grate a carrot or two (depending on their size).</p>
                <p>This will add a little color to a normal bland looking item.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="steps">
                <img class="layout3r" src="images/sauerkraut_03.jpg" alt="Onion, Fennel and Daikon Radish">
                <p class="brief">Add a little texture</p>
                <p>Coarsely chop an onion (upper left), fennel (lower middle) and thinly slice daikon half moons (upper
                    right).</p>
                <p>These items ferment very well, while still retaining a bit of a crunch.</p>

                <p>Wakame (sea vegetable)... coarsely cut with scissors and rehydrated before adding to the mix.</p>
                <p>Aside from adding color and flovor to the sauerkraut, Sea vegetables are an excellent source of
                    iodine.</p>

                <p>Cabbage cores blended in high speed blender (in this case, a Vitamix) with water added to make it a
                    puree.</p>
                <p>This will be step one in jumpstarting the brining process.</p>

                <p class="brief">Keep on brining </p>
                <p>Coarsely chop a couple heads of green cabbage. Vigorously massage it to help break down the fibers
                    in advance. Mix it up with some
                    nappa or red cabbage for variety if youâ€™d like.</p>
                <p>This step accelerates the brining process.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="steps">
                <p class="brief">Finishing it off</p>
                <p>Mix all ingredients. Place whole cabbage leaves over the top of the mixture to prevent oxidation,
                    with a plate going over
                    them and a weight on top of that (eg: a gallon of water). Place a towel over the container to keep
                    bugs
                    out. This will yield several quarts.</p>

                <p>The liquid level
                    should start at about an inch above the bottom and slowly rise. By the second day, the mixture

                    be fully or nearly fully submerged. <br /><br />After 2.5 to 4 days (depending upon the ambient
                    temperature and the level of fermentation you
                    prefer), <b>the sauerkraut is done!</b></p>
