# Mike Gullo on GitHub

## Summary

I've been programming for 15+ years and am a recent graduate from the Case Western Reserve University Full Stack program (having been a consistent A+ student)... solidifying my skills as a developer/programmer and am now ready to pursue programming as a career.

Not only do I take pride in my coding efficiency and proficiency, I'm always eager to expand my skills into new areas. Solving problems, understanding the code and becoming better at programming has become very addictive.

## Work History

My most recent professional role was in designing, building and maintaining a sizable array of nearly 300 high-end cryptocurrency mining servers, which also included programming graphics card bioses and writing configuration files for running them. After working in the tech field for 30+ years as an electronics technician, I'm thinking it's time for a change.
