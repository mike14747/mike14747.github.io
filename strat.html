            <h2 id="content_header">Strat-O-Matic Baseball</h2>

            <p>I started playing Strat-O-Matic Baseball way back in 1980 and soon became hooked for life. It all started with a limted number of teams in a simple selector set of the 1979 season. Back then, the game was played with cards, dice and charts. Beginning in 1996, Strat started producing a computer version of the game... moving those tactile objects behind the scenes into the computer's software.</p>
            <p>With the cards, charts, dice and rules of the game it was immediately obvious that, while it was a game based upon realism, each particular event (at-bat, stolen base attempt, sac bunt, etc) was a chance outcome. The odds of outcomes were set (by those same cards, charts, dice and rules of the game), but since dice were being roled for each event, each event was probabalistic. In many (even most) parts of the game, it's easy to calculate the odds of specific outcomes.</p>
            <p>I've been part of a few leagues here and there, but I've been fascinated (some might even say obsessed) with the more obscure aspects of the game... namely defensive ratings and their impact on not just the odds of any particular role's outcome, but also the longer term game/season outcomes.</p>
            <p class="brief">Enter Defensive Evaluations</p>
            <p>Way back in 2004, I created a product known as <span class="strong">Defensive Evaluations</span>. Defensive Evaluations was essentially an Excel spreadsheet where you would enter a player's range and e-number to see its impact upon various things (out%, extra OBP/hitter, hits allowed/season, extra on-base chances/hitter, errors adjusted for the number rolls/season in your league, x-number DPs turned/season, extra DP chances/hitter, baserunners allowed/season, runs allowed/season and OPS allowed on x-numners).</p>
            <p><img class="compare" src="images/compare.jpg" alt="Defensive Evaluations">It was quite an undertaking because, while many of those thing are easy to calculate if you know something about Strat fielding charts and dice roll odds, other parts required a lot of research into base/out information and runs created values for specific events (as in the difference between a GB(2B)C and a GB(2B)A. Both are outs, but they definitely have different 'runs created';' values.</p>
            <p>A big improvement was moving all that data to a database on a server and having it available on a website where the user can tinker with many of the values I've set behind the scenes. If they want to disable the impact of holding on runners or having the infield in, they can disable it. Yes, those options were available on the spreadsheet. However, in addition to just those options, the user would be able to change or disable more values under the hood. I'm envisioning a website that would allow a user to enter a range rating and e-number for a specific position, edit the 'runs created' values for each of the possible event outcomes... or any values behind the scenes for that matter. I currently have a somewhat crude version of this on my own server with the thoughts of making it available to the internet, but publishing it on a website.</p>
            <p>So, reviving (and improving) Defensive Evaluations has been on my mind lately, but so has another product that has been elusive to the Strat community. Deciphering the annual ratings guide Strat releases in mid January. If you play in a league or are using league rules that don't include ballpark effect or clutch hitting, the ratings guide is only of limited insight into true on-base, total base and HR chances on ech player's card... since it provides those numbers based upon leagues that do use ballpark effects and clutch hitting.</p>
            <p class="brief">Moving on to Ratings Guide +</p>
            <p>I have a beta version of the new project running on my home computer. It's current an unnamed project, though maybe I should just call it 'Ratings Guide +'.</p>
            <p>What I've done is begin the info in Strat's ratings guide, factor in ballpark effects for the stadium each player played in and clutch hitting. That enabled me to get true on-base and total base chances. I combined them together using a slightly on-base weighted scale into somewhat of an OPS+ rating.  From there, I deducted on-base and slugging chances based upon DP chances on their cards. I also made on-base and total base decutions for those players rated as power 'W', since they will lose total base chances when the roles are on the pitcher's cards. What I end up with is a single number that takes in the whole scope of a player's 'vs leftu' or 'vs righty' card. There are some limitations, including:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I don't yet know how to apply this to players that have played for multiple teams, so they are omitted.</li>
                <li>Strat only rounds their chances to a single significant digit...  increasing the margins of error.</li>
                <li>I've found they don't include split number DP chances (regarless of the probability of their outcome) in their listed DP chances.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I should add that I've done this for pitchers as well. For pitchers, I've included the same elements as hitters (except for power rating deductions since they don't apply), but also included the pitcher's defensive range/e-number, Balk and WP ratings.</p>
            <p>Keep on eye out for this being made available in the future. I'll make mention of its release with links to it right here, so stay tuned.</p>
