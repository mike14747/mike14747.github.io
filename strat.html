                <p>I started playing Strat-O-Matic Baseball way back in 1980 and soon became hooked for life. It all
                    started
                    with a limted number of teams in a simple selector set of the 1979 season. Back then, the game was
                    played with cards, dice and charts. Beginning in 1996, Strat started producing a computer version of
                    the
                    game... moving those tactile objects behind the scenes into the computer's software.</p>
                <p>With the cards, charts, dice and rules of the game it was immediately obvious that, while it was a
                    game based upon realism, each particular event (at-bat, stolen base attempt, sac bunt, etc) was a
                    chance
                    outcome. The odds of outcomes were set (by those same cards, charts, dice and rules of the game),
                    but since dice were being roled for each event, each event was probabalistic. In many (even most)
                    parts
                    of the game, it's easy to calculate the odds of specific outcomes.</p>
                <p>I've been part of a few leagues here and there, but I've been fascinated (some might even say
                    obsessed) with the more obscure aspects of the game... namely defensive ratings and their impact on
                    not just
                    the odds of any particular role's outcome, but also the longer term game/season outcomes.</p>
                <p class="brief">Enter Defensive Evaluations</p>
                <p>Way back in 2004, I created a product known as <b>Defensive Evaluations</b>.
                    Defensive Evaluations was essentially an Excel spreadsheet where you would enter a player's
                    range and e-number to see its impact upon various things (out%, extra OBP/hitter, hits
                    allowed/season,
                    extra on-base chances/hitter, errors adjusted for the number rolls/season in your league, x-number
                    DPs turned/season, extra DP chances/hitter, baserunners allowed/season, runs allowed/season and
                    OPS allowed on x-numners).</p>
                <p><img class="img-fluid float-right ml-4" src="images/compare.jpg" alt="Defensive Evaluations">It was
                    quite an undertaking
                    because, while many of those thing are easy to calculate if you know something about Strat fielding
                    charts and dice roll odds, other parts required a lot of research into base/out information and runs
                    created values for specific events (as in the difference between a GB(2B)C and a GB(2B)A. Both are
                    outs,
                    but they definitely have different 'runs created';' values.</p>
                <p>A big improvement was moving all that data to a database on a server and having it available on a
                    website where the user can tinker with many of the values I've set behind the scenes. If they want
                    to
                    disable the impact of holding on runners or having the infield in, they can disable it. Yes, those
                    options
                    were available on the spreadsheet. However, in addition to just those options, the user would be
                    able to
                    change or disable more values under the hood. I'm envisioning a website that would allow a user to
                    enter a range rating and e-number for a specific position, edit the 'runs created' values for each
                    of the
                    possible event outcomes... or any values behind the scenes for that matter. I currently have a
                    somewhat crude version of this on my own server with the thoughts of making it available to the
                    internet, but
                    publishing it on a website.</p>
                <p>So, reviving (and improving) Defensive Evaluations has been on my mind lately, but so has another
                    product that has been elusive to the Strat community. Deciphering the annual ratings guide Strat
                    releases in
                    mid January. If you play in a league or are using league rules that don't include ballpark effect or
                    clutch hitting, the ratings guide is only of limited insight into true on-base, total base and HR
                    chances
                    on each player's card... since it provides those numbers based upon leagues that do use ballpark
                    effects
                    and clutch hitting.</p>
                <p class="brief">Moving on to Ratings Guide +</p>
                <p>I have a beta version of the new project running on my home computer. It's current an unnamed
                    project, though maybe I should just call it 'Ratings Guide +'.</p>
                <p>What I've done is begin the info in Strat's ratings guide, factor in ballpark effects for the stadium
                    each player played in and clutch hitting. That enabled me to get true on-base and total base
                    chances. I combined them together using a slightly on-base weighted scale into somewhat of an OPS+
                    rating. From
                    there, I deducted on-base and slugging chances based upon DP chances on their cards. I also made
                    on-base and total base decutions for those players rated as power 'W', since they will lose total
                    base
                    chances when the roles are on the pitcher's cards. What I end up with is a single number that takes
                    in the
                    whole scope of a player's 'vs leftu' or 'vs righty' card. There are some limitations, including:</p>
                <ol class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">I don't yet know how to apply this to players that have played for
                        multiple teams, so they are omitted.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Strat only rounds their chances to a single significant digit...
                        increasing the margins of error.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">I've found they don't include split number DP chances (regarless of the
                        probability of their outcome) in their listed DP chances.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I should add that I've done this for pitchers as well. For pitchers, I've included the same elements
                    as hitters (except for power rating deductions since they don't apply), but also included the
                    pitcher's
                    defensive range/e-number, Balk and WP ratings.</p>
                <p>Keep on eye out for this being made available in the future. I'll make mention of its release with
                    links to it right here, so stay tuned.</p>
