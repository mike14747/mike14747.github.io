            <p>Starbuck and Savannah were born on Christmas day in 2008. They are the offspring of parents that were an Autstralian Shephard and a Border Collie.</p>
            <p>Starbuck (at 82 pounds on the right in the picture below) looks just like his Australian Shephard parent and Savannah (at 42 pounds on the left in the picture below) looks just like her Border Collie parent. Though those breeds do have a lot of similar colorings, they do have different body types and fur.</p>
            <p>I adopted them when they were 3 years old. They were completely untrained and out of control to say the least. After years of hard work, they've come a long way. The only time they now need to be on a leash is during walks through the neighbohood.</p>
