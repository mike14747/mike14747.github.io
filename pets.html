                <p class="brief">Starbuck and Savannah</p>
                <p>Starbuck and Savannah were born on Christmas day in 2008. They are the offspring of parents that were
                    an
                    Autstralian Shephard and a Border Collie.</p>
                <p>Starbuck (at 82 pounds on the right in the picture below) looks just like his Australian Shephard
                    parent
                    and Savannah (at 42 pounds on the left in the picture below) looks just like her Border Collie
                    parent.
                    Though those breeds do have a lot of similar colorings, they do have different body types and fur.
                </p>
                <p>I adopted them when they were 3 years old. They were completely untrained and out of control to say
                    the
                    least. After years of hard work, they've come a long way. The only time they now need to be on a
                    leash
                    is during walks through the neighbohood.</p>

                <p class="brief">On to the Cats</p>
                <p>Here's a brief glimpse at some of the many cats I have or had since 1992. Most, if not all, are
                    rescued
                    from various situations. A couple were inherted from a marriage. They are all so unique.</p>

                    <p>Mr Shen (right) has always been a snuggler... with any cat, dog or person that will allow it.</p>

                    <p>Lamby with her favorite toys. She would carry the stuffed lamby around the house while making
                        crying noises... as
                        if it were her baby. Even though it was nearly her size, she managed to do it.</p>

                    <p>Beeber was always the bully of the house, until one day he had an unknown accident and became
                        disabled. Through
                        weeks of my own physical therapy program, I was able to get him somewhat back to using his back
                        legs, though he
                        had to walk slowly and with a very noticeable limp.</p>
                    <p>Here he's enjoying some time in the garden.</p>

                    <p>The Kitten (left) was another rescued cat. She was undernourished as a kitten and never grew
                        beyond, well, the
                        size of a kitten. She's still fairly feral even today and will likely always be.</p>

                <p class="brief">Big Buster</p>
                <p>Last, but not least, is my favorite cat of all time, Big Buster. He was rescued as a month old kitten
                    from an alley
                    in the inner city. He went on to become the most loving animal I've ever encountered.</p>

                <p>Thunder was inherited via marriage. Pistol (another rescued cat), found dogs much more to her
                    liking
                    than cats... and
                    Thunder was her favorite dog of all.</p>
